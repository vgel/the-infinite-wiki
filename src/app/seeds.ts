<title> H.M.B. Emple </title>
<article> The H.M.B. Emple was a [[Late Persippan]] era [[blimp]] commissioned by the eccentric billionaire [[Cornelius Quixotica]] in [[1887 PE]] (Post-Emergence). Measuring over 300 meters in length, the Emple was the largest airship ever constructed at the time.
The blimp's hull was crafted from a revolutionary new material known as [[Levitanium]], an ultra-lightweight alloy imbued with anti-gravitational properties discovered by the reclusive scientist [[Dr. Erasmus Flotsome]]. This allowed the Emple to achieve unparalleled buoyancy and maneuverability compared to contemporary airships.

The Emple disappeared without a trace in [[1889 PE]], in what is considered one of the first widely-publicized cases of [[Mass Hyperstition]].

<title> Cyberware </title>
<article> Cyberware refers to [[cybernetic hardware]], [[technological]] implants, and [[robot|robotic]] prosthetics that can be integrated into the human body to replace lost limbs or organs, or to enhance strength, senses, and abilities beyond natural human levels.

The term "cyberware" was coined by [[Dr. Laric Partmon]] in 2032, recipient of the first [[high-bandwidth neural implant]], to group together several disparate fields of [[human enhancement technologies]]: 
- [[Artificial Intelligence]]
- [[Prosthetic Limbs]]
- [[Sensory Enhancements]]
- [[Subdermal Implants]]
- [[Neural Implants]]
- [[Artificial Organs]]
- [[Exoskeletons]]

The field of cyberware is rapidly advancing, with new breakthroughs constantly expanding the possibilities of [[human-machine integration]]. However, access to cyberware remains heavily restricted and regulated in many parts of the world.

Opposition from [[anti-augmentation activists]], concerns over [[cyberware-related health complications]], and fears of creating an augmented "[[overclass]]" have greatly limited the availability of cyberware to the general public. [[Black markets]] have emerged to meet the demand for [[illegal and experimental cyberware]].

<title> The Temple of Zardok-Ra </title>
<article>
The Temple of Zardok-Ra is an [[ancient Egyptian]] temple complex believed to have been constructed in the [[13th Dynasty]], circa [[1750 BCE]], and dedicated to cultic worship of the [[Old Gods]]. The temple is located deep within the [[Valley of Ombos]], carved into the limestone cliffs.

Excavations at the site began in 1922, led by the enigmatic [[Professor Alastair Blackwell]]. The temple layout resembles a massive seven-pointed star, with a large central [[Altar Chamber]] and seven radiating [[Halls of Invocation]]. The walls are covered in intricate [[hieroglyphs]] and unsettling [[bas-reliefs]] depicting strange [[rituals]] and [[human sacrifice]].

At the heart of the temple lies a massive [[obsidian obelisk]] covered in glowing, [[otherworld runes|otherworldly runes]]. Blackwell postulated this was used to summon and communicate with [[Zardok-Ra]], a little-known [[deity]] associated with [[chaos magic]], [[dimensional gateways]], and [[hyperstitional prophecies]].

Since its discovery, the temple has been linked to a number of mysterious disappearances, occult phenomena, and [[localized reality distortions]]. The [[1925 Ombos Valley Earthquake]] caused the temple to collapse, killing Professor Blackwell and his team. The site was subsequently sealed off by Egyptian authorities.

Some [[occult scholars]] believe the Temple of Zardok-Ra was one of several sites around the globe built to worship the [[Outer Gods]] and pave the way for the prophesied return of their lord [[Cthulhu]]. The true nature and powers of the temple remain an enigma.
